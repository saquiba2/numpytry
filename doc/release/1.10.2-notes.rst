NumPy 1.10.2 Release Notes
**************************

This release deals with a number of bugs that turned up in 1.10.1 and
adds various build and release improvements.

Numpy 1.10.1 supports Python 2.6 - 2.7 and 3.2 - 3.5.


Compatibility notes
===================

fix swig bug in ``numpy.i``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Relaxed stride checking revealed a bug in ``array_is_fortran(a)``, that was
using PyArray_ISFORTRAN to check for Fortran contiguity instead of
PyArray_IS_F_CONTIGUOUS. You may want to regenerate swigged files using the
updated numpy.i

Issues Fixed

Initial support for mingwpy was reverted as it was causing problems for
non-windows builds.

* gh-6536 BUG: Revert gh-5614 to fix non-windows build problems

A fix for np.lib.split was reverted because it resulted in "fixing"
behavior will be present in the Numpy 1.11 and was already present in
Numpy 1.9. See the discussion of the issue at gh-6575 for clarification.

* gh-6576 BUG: Revert gh-6376 to fix split behavior for empty arrays.

Notes
=====
A bug in the Numpy 1.10.1 release resulted in exceptions being raised for
``RuntimeWarning`` and ``DeprecationWarning`` in projects depending on Numpy.
That has been fixed.
